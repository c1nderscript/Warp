# ADR-0002: Disconnected Component Removal Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context

During comprehensive connectivity analysis of the Twitch platform, we identified 45 components that have no connectivity to the core infrastructure domains. These disconnected components include repository metadata, development tooling, build artifacts, configuration files, and documentation fragments that do not participate in the platform's operational architecture.

The presence of disconnected components in our documentation system creates several challenges:
- **Documentation Noise**: Non-functional items dilute focus from operational components
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Resources spent tracking non-operational artifacts
- **Misleading Architecture Views**: Disconnected items suggest false system complexity
- **Search Inefficiency**: Developers encounter irrelevant results when seeking operational documentation

Graph traversal analysis using breadth-first search confirmed that these 45 components have no paths to the 8 core components (chat, video, web, commerce, identity, security, content, eventbus) that form the operational backbone of the platform.

## Decision

We implement a **systematic removal strategy** for disconnected components based on connectivity analysis and functional relevance:

### Removal Categories

#### Immediate Removal (No Grace Period)
**Repository Artifacts**: Non-functional metadata and build artifacts
- README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE files
- Build directories (target/, build/, dist/)
- Configuration files (.gitignore, .editorconfig)
- Package metadata (package.json fragments, Cargo.toml snippets)

**Development Tooling**: Local development and testing infrastructure
- Test directories (test/, tests/, benches/)
- Documentation build tools (docs/ build systems)
- CLI command implementations (cmd/ directories)
- Development scripts and utilities

#### Conditional Removal (30-Day Grace Period)
**Repository References**: Components that reference external repositories
- Abbreviations and mermaid diagram references
- Cross-repository integration stubs
- External dependency placeholders

**Team Artifacts**: Individual contributor workspaces without operational components
- Personal development environments
- Individual team directories with no production services
- Experimental code without integration points

### Removal Process

#### Phase 1: Automated Flagging (Week 1)
1. **Connectivity Analysis**: Run graph traversal to identify disconnected components
2. **Automated Marking**: Update Coverage.md with "disconnected" status
3. **Task Generation**: Create removal tasks in Tasks.md with appropriate backlinks
4. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert component owners about disconnected status

#### Phase 2: Validation (Week 2-3)  
1. **Manual Review**: Component owners validate disconnected status
2. **False Positive Handling**: Process appeals for incorrectly flagged components
3. **Integration Discovery**: Identify hidden dependencies not captured in analysis
4. **Exception Requests**: Handle special cases requiring preservation

#### Phase 3: Execution (Week 4)
1. **Batch Removal**: Remove confirmed disconnected components from tracking
2. **Documentation Cleanup**: Update Coverage.md and related documentation
3. **Backlink Maintenance**: Clean up orphaned cross-references
4. **Archive Creation**: Create archive record of removed components

## Justification

### Operational Benefits
- **Reduced Noise**: Focus documentation efforts on operational components (85% noise reduction)
- **Faster Navigation**: Developers find relevant components more efficiently
- **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminate tracking overhead for 45 non-operational items
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Present accurate system complexity and component relationships

### Analytical Evidence
**Connectivity Analysis Results:**
- **Core Components**: 8 essential infrastructure components identified
- **Peripheral Components**: 8 components connected to core (maintained)
- **Disconnected Components**: 45 components with zero connectivity (flagged for removal)
- **Total Analyzed**: 61 valid components (filtered from 215 raw entries)

**Disconnected Component Breakdown:**
- Repository metadata: 12 components
- Development tooling: 15 components  
- Build artifacts: 8 components
- Documentation fragments: 6 components
- Abbreviations/references: 4 components

### Risk Mitigation
- **Archive Strategy**: Maintain record of removed components for historical reference
- **Appeal Process**: 30-day grace period for stakeholder review and appeals
- **Rollback Capability**: Archived components can be restored if operational relevance discovered
- **Documentation Trail**: Complete removal audit trail in Changelog.md

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Documentation Quality**: Higher signal-to-noise ratio in component documentation
- **Developer Experience**: Faster discovery of operational components
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Reduced overhead for tracking non-operational items
- **Architecture Clarity**: Accurate representation of system connectivity and complexity
- **Resource Optimization**: Focus documentation efforts on high-value operational components

### Negative  
- **Information Loss**: Historical context from removed components may be lost
- **False Positives**: Risk of removing components with hidden operational relevance
- **Stakeholder Resistance**: Teams may object to removal of "their" components
- **Rollback Complexity**: Restoring removed components requires process overhead

### Neutral
- **Baseline Reset**: New starting point for component inventory and tracking
- **Process Learning**: Removal process insights inform future connectivity analysis
- **Tool Evolution**: Connectivity analysis tools improve based on removal experience

## Implementation Details

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Connectivity analysis algorithm
def identify_disconnected_components():
    core_components = ['chat', 'video', 'web', 'commerce', 'identity', 'security', 'content', 'eventbus']
    graph = build_dependency_graph()
    
    connected = set()
    for core in core_components:
        connected.update(bfs_find_paths(graph, core))
    
    all_components = set(graph.nodes())
    disconnected = all_components - connected
    return disconnected
```

### Documentation Updates
- **Coverage.md**: Mark disconnected components with "disconnected" status
- **Tasks.md**: Generate removal tasks with backlinks to Coverage.md
- **Component Cards**: Remove cards for disconnected components
- **Changelog.md**: Record all removal actions with timestamps and justifications

### Monitoring and Validation
- **Removal Metrics**: Track number and types of components removed
- **Appeal Tracking**: Monitor false positive rate and appeal success rate  
- **Connectivity Changes**: Regular re-analysis to catch newly disconnected components
- **Developer Feedback**: Survey satisfaction with reduced documentation noise

## Success Criteria
- Remove 45 disconnected components within 30-day timeline
- < 10% appeal rate indicating accurate connectivity analysis
- Improved developer satisfaction with documentation discoverability
- No operational impact from removed components
